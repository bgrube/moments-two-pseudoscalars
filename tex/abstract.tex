  Moment analysis of (quasi-)two-body decays can be a helpful tool to
  study the partial-wave content of data and to verify the consistency
  of a partial-wave analysis (PWA).  In this note, we collect and in
  some cases derive the formulas needed to perform moment analyses of
  systems of two spinless particles.  We discuss in particular two
  cases: diffractive production using meson beams and photoproduction
  with linearly polarized photons.
